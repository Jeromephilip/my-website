				<h5 class="experience-description">Kumon Math and Reading Tutor</h5>
				During weeknights, I devote my time to tutoring math and reading comprehension/writing skills to students ranging from elementary to high school. During these times, I usually correct
				their assigned homework and help the students with a topic that they are having trouble with. All in all, it is a fun experience and I learn a lot of skills 
				working at Kumon Waterloo North.

				Junior Achievement is a large youth business program in Canada that educate high school students about financial literacy, work readiness and entrepreneurship with the help of educators
				volunteers and local businesses. At my time there, I was the Vice President of Finance of a company called Eternal Essence. Our product was a candle case with a unique design which helped 
				to create a more fashionable and zen home-environment. As the VP of Finance, I was in charge of creating and organizing financial documents (balance sheets, income statements, etc.) and

				the provincial level. Throughout the preperation for these events, I learned basic principles of business which included entrepreneurship, finance, and marketing.

				In the summertime, I helped in conducting 2 hour programming sessions to children (ages 8-11) in languages like scratch and python. In these sessions, we would learn the basic syntax and operations of a language and then
				apply it to a project that I would provide them to finish. The children were successful building projects like snake, pong, and role-playing games.
